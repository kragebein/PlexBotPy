# PlexBotPy



PlexbotPy is my private bot not really ment for everyone. It communicates with, thetvdb, medusa, couchpotato, omdb, tautulli, Plex, and discord/facebook to create a bot that can be used for maintaining a Plex Library. 


This project is nowhere near complete, and probably never will be as i'm always working on it.
If you really need this to run, you need to create bot/database.sql as the bot will require this to run most of its things.


Just edit config.cfg and then run ./plexbot.py

Fixed, always on-commands:
>!load, !unload !search, !request

Dynamically loaded commands:
>!missing, !plex, !raise, playtime

Repost plugin also adds a regex command that triggers on every match to the regex.
